# Acousterr-Tabs
Extracts the tabs from acousterr site and writes them to a file for ease of learning...

So recently I have been trying to learn a song from the site and I found the tab to be accurate, so wanted to copy the tab for future references, but the site notified me to upgrade to their premium plan to be able to copy the tab and I said fuck you 😊, I don't need to copy from your site rather I will dig it out 😂😂

## Usage

To use the script, download two modules using

```
pip install requests bs4
```

Then copy the site link and paste it. The file will be generated with the tabs...
Enjoy playing 🎸 😉
